\section{Introduction}

The Python Estimation Package, which I am referring to as \textbf{pyest}, was developed to solve the problem presented by the CU-Boulder Statistical Orbit Determination (ASEN-5070) term project; establish the orbit of fictional Earth-orbiting spacecraft by processing 6 hours worth of simulated tracking data. The software is presented here in the context of that problem; the underlying force model is explained, the equations of motion are derived, and the batch and sequential filtering algorithms are developed. 

%Because this software was developed to solve this specific problem, many of it's assumptions are baked into the code. Every attempt was made to extract constant values and make them easy to edit, as a way to ``generalize" the code, but the equations of motion which are being integrated, and used later in the derivation of the filter, are very specific to this project. If this code were to be applied to another orbit determination problem, these modules would have to be reviewed and possibly re-derived.

\section{Orbit Determination Project Description}

The fictional spacecraft in this problem has an altitude of ~800 km and an inclination of around 98.6 degrees, an orbit modeled after the Quickscat satellite. It moves with two-body dynamics, perturbed only by the Earth's oblateness and atmosphere. We are given 6 hours of simulated tracking data along with an initial estimate of the spacecraft state at some (unspecified) epoch, which we process using both batch and sequential filters to establish the best estimate of the orbit.
 
\subsection{Equations of motion}

The spacecraft is assumed to be under the influence of two-body gravitation (s/c and Earth), including the effect of the oblateness of Earth (J2) but ignoring all higher order gravitational shape parameters. The potential function for this gravity field is:

\begin{equation}
 U = U_{pointmass} + U_{J_2} =  \frac{\mu}{r}\left[ 1 - J_2\left(\frac{R_{earth}}{r}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{2}\sin^2{\psi} - \frac{1}{2}\right) \right]
\end{equation}

The spacecraft is also assumed to experience drag due to Earth atmosphere, where the acceleration due to drag on the spacecraft is given by:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\ddot{\bar{r}}_{drag} & =  - \frac{1}{2} C_d \left( \frac{A}{m}\right) \rho_A V_A \bar{V}_A\\
\text{with}\\
V_A & = \sqrt{ (\dot{x} +  \dot{\theta}y)^2 + (\dot{y} -  \dot{\theta}x)^2 + (\dot{z})^2 } \\
\rho_A & = \rho_0 e^{\frac{-(r-r_0)}{H}} \\
\bar{V}_A & = 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
     \dot{x} +  \dot{\theta}y \\
     \dot{y} -  \dot{\theta}x\\
     \dot{z}    
     \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Under the influence of these forces, the acceleration of the spacecraft is given by:

\begin{equation}
\ddot{r} =  \ddot{r}_{twobody} + \ddot{r}_{J_2} + \ddot{r}_{drag} 
\end{equation}

Leading to the following equations of motion (given in differential form):

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\dot{X}  & = U \\
\dot{Y}  & = V \\
\dot{Z}  & = W \\
\dot{U} & = \frac{-\mu X}{r^3}\left[ 1 - \frac{3}{2}J_2\left(\frac{R_{earth}}{r}\right)^2 \left(5 \left(\frac{Z}{r}\right)^2 - 1 \right)\right]  -  \frac{1}{2} C_d \left( \frac{A}{m}\right) \rho_A V_A ( \dot{X} +  \dot{\theta}Y)\\
\dot{V} & = \frac{-\mu Y}{r^3}\left[ 1 - \frac{3}{2}J_2\left(\frac{R_{earth}}{r}\right)^2 \left(5 \left(\frac{Z}{r}\right)^2 - 1 \right)\right]  -  \frac{1}{2} C_d \left( \frac{A}{m}\right) \rho_A V_A (\dot{Y} -  \dot{\theta}X) \\
\dot{W} & = \frac{-\mu Z}{r^3}\left[ 1 - \frac{3}{2}J_2\left(\frac{R_{earth}}{r}\right)^2 \left(5 \left(\frac{Z}{r}\right)^2 - 3 \right)\right] -  \frac{1}{2} C_d \left( \frac{A}{m}\right) \rho_A V_A ( \dot{Z}) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

These equations are numerically integrated using a Runge-kutta (8)9 integrator in the package. 

\subsection{Tracking Measurements}

Our fictional spacecraft is being tracked by three Earth ground stations, taking both range and range-rate measurements. The equations below give the analytic form of the measurement types:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho  & = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 + X_s^2 + Y_s^2 + Z_s^2 - 2 (X  X_s + Y  Y_s )\cos{\theta} + 2( X Y_s - Y X_s)\sin{\theta} - 2 Z Z_s}  \\
\dot{\rho} & = \frac{X \dot{X} + Y \dot{Y} + Z \dot{Z} - (\dot{X} X_s + \dot{Y} Y_s ) \cos{\theta} + \dot{\theta} (X X_s + Y Y_s) \sin{\theta} + (\dot{X} Y_s - \dot{Y} X_s) \sin{\theta} + \dot{\theta} (X Y_s - Y X_s) \cos{\theta} - Z Z_s}{\rho}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Developing the Batch and Sequential Filters}

Based on the project description and equations of motion, we can now begin developing our OD filters. First we establish the state vector which is to be estimated. Then we linearize the state and measurement equations by forming the $A$ and $\tilde{H}$ matrices. Finally, we layout the estimation algorithm for the batch and sequential filters. 

\subsection{State Vector}

The full state which we are estimating consists of 18 parameters; the spacecraft cartesian state at epoch, spacecraft coefficient of drag, the Earths GM and $J_2$, and the ECI cartesian location of the three tracking stations. Table 1 lists the state vector and their a priori values, to the full precision given by the project instructions. Because these values are being numerically integrated and used in matrix inversions it is important that they be expressed to their max precision.

\begin{table}[htdp]

\end{table}%


\subsection{Linearized system}

Both the equations of motion and measurement-state equations are non-linear systems. We can use them to, respectively, calculate the position of the spacecraft at some future time and the ``computed" measurements at that time; however, propagating the state and measurement uncertainties through time using the non-linear equations is problematic. Therefore, before we can build our filters we need to linearize the system. 
The first step is to form our state deviation vector $x(t)$. The true state at time $t$ is $X(t)$, the corresponding state on our reference trajectory is $X^*(t)$, which makes our state deviation vector $x(t) = X(t) - X^*(t)$. As long as the difference between the true state and our reference state is ``small", our linear assumption will hold and our filters will function. However, if our reference trajectory wanders too far from the true trajectory, our linear filters will diverge.
 The full linearization procedure is covered in detail on pages [160 - 164] of the reference text. Here we focus on deriving the  the $A$ and $\tilde{H}$ matrices, which are the prime players in linearizing the state and measurement equations, respectively. 
 
The $A$ matrix is has the rank of our state vector (18), and is simply the matrix of partial derivatives of our differential state vector with respect to our state elements.

\begin{equation}
A  = 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
     \frac{\partial\dot{\bar{X}}}{\partial\bar{X}}      
     \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

It is used to form our linearized differential state equations and derive the \emph{state transition matrix}, $\Phi(t,t_0)$, which can be used to map our state deviation vector and errors from our epoch at $t_0$ to any time $t$ (or vice-versa);

\begin{equation}
\dot{\Phi}(t,t_0)  = A(t)^* \Phi(t,t_0)
\end{equation}

The asterisk on $A(t)$ in the above equation is meant to signify that it is being evaluated against the reference trajectory at time $t$.

The $\tilde{H}$ matrix has rank equal to the number of measurement types we are using, and is the matrix of partial derivatives of our measurements with respect to our state elements.

\begin{equation}
\tilde{H} = 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
     \frac{\partial\bar{\rho}}{\partial\bar{X}}      
     \end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}

The $\tilde{H}(t)$ matrix, again evaluated against the reference trajectory at time $t$, maps deviations and errors in our state space into deviations and errors in our measurement space. 

Both $A$ and $\tilde{H}$ are \emph{built} by evaluating the (non-linear) state ($\bar{X}$) at time $t$, but they can only \emph{operate} on the state deviation vector ($\bar{x}$) at time $t$; this is an important distinction.

\subsection{Batch Algorithm}

With our linearized system established, we can now build our batch filtering algorithm.

\subsection{Sequential Algorithm}
Give an outline of the Sequential algorithm here.

\section{\textbf{pyest} Package}

The project code is implemented in the Python programming language. It makes extensive use of \textbf{numpy} / \textbf{scipy}'s matrix and numerical integrations capabilities, and \textbf{matplotlib}'s plotting utilities ( \textbf{numpy} / \textbf{scipy} and \textbf{matplotlib} are both third-party, open source extensions to the Python core). 
Python was chosen in favor of Matlab for several reasons, including

\begin{itemize}
\item Python is free and open-source, making it less expensive to develop and more accessible to others (since a Matlab liscence isn't a precursor to running the code).
\item Python is a full-weight programming language, with plug-ins for pretty much every type of software application. Time spent learning Python is time well invested. 
\item The Python module / package system is ideal for organizing code in a logical and comprehensible fashion.
\item Python's insistence on indentation forces easy to read, beautiful code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Package organization}
The package is organized into four sub-modules, depicted in figure blah and described below:

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=2in]{pyest_package.png}
\caption{Layout of pyest packaget}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[filter] The heart of the package. It contains code defining the $A$ and $\tilde{H}$ matrices, the batch and sequential filtering algorithms, and functions for presenting and plotting results.
\item[data] Contains project data, including a priori values, constants, and observations.
\item[doc] The source latex code for this report.
\item[test] Defines tests which check sub-functions against the reference values given on the ASEN-5070 website.
\item[project\_main.py] This is the command line utility that runs the filters.
\end{description}

The major elements of the filter module have been attached as an appendix to this report. The source code in it's entirety is viewable and downloadable online in a github repository at https://github.com/jeremiahbuddha/pyest. 

\subsection{Installing and running \textbf{pyest}}

As previously mentioned, pyest is available for download in a github repository. It is entirely self-contained, so you can download it directly to your computer, and once the dependencies have been installed, run it.

Before executing \textbf{pyest}, you must make sure that a suitable version of Python, along with other dependencies, have been installed on your machine. \textbf{pyest} was built using Python v2.7, and this is the recommended version to run it with. Also, as previously mentioned, the package requires numpy / scipy and matplotlib. An easy way to obtain all the dependencies required to run the package is to download the latest version of EPDFree from Enthought Inc., an excellent distributor of scientific programming toolkits for Python.

It is also necessary to check the pound line in \emph{project\_main.py} to make sure that it is pointing to the correct python executable on your machine. Currently, the line reads \emph{\#! /usr/bin/env python}, but it may need to be changed if, for instance, you install EPDFree, to the correct python binary for that distribution.

Once Python and other dependencies have been installed, you can run the OD filter by running \emph{project\_main.py} via a command line terminal, \emph{project\_main.py filter\_type number\_of\_iters}, where the filter type can be 'batch' or 'sequential' and the number of iterations an integer. For example, to run the batch filter with two iterations, you would use  \emph{project\_main.py batch 2}. This sets the filter running,  and also display plots of the pre / post-fit residuals, and prints the value of $\hat{x}$ for each iteration.

\section{Discussion of Results}

The pyest package has been used to process the project tracking data and obtain a best estimate of the spacecraft state at epoch. The following is a discussion of the results obtained running both the batch and sequential filters.

\subsection{Batch Results}

Figure X and Table X show the results from running the batch filter three times in progression, where the best estimate for one iteration gets fed into the next as the new a priori (with the exception of the a priori covariance, which remained constant for all three iterations). We expect that the linear filter will not be able to precisely lock down the non-linear trajectory after one pass-through of the data. Rather, each subsequent iteration pushes the linear solution closer and closer to the true trajectory until it ``converges" on the best estimate , i.e. the deviation vector stops improving for continued iterations. Table X indeed shows the state parameters converging to values by the third iteration, with the notable exception of the three constant parameters $\mu$, $J_2$ and $C_d$. More on this later. 

An examination of Figure X also shows this convergence in process, and also reveals the mis-match between the linear filter and non-linear dynamics. All three iterations produce progressively tighter prefit / postfit residuals, but there remains a mis-match in all three cases between the prefit and postfit residuals. For instance, the filter was able to lay the postfit residuals for iteration two flat, but when the best-estimate state was reintegrated with full non-linear dynamics it failed to produce the same ``linear" trajectory.

\subsection{Sequential Results}

Ideally, the sequential algorithm would produce the exact same results as the batch. Numerical errors however prevent this from being realized, as can be seen from the values for $\hat{x}$ given in table X. On the whole, however, the sequential algorithm shows results consistent with the batch filter, including the curious mis-match that was noted above.

\subsection{Convergence issues}

I have not been able to establish whether the failure in  $\mu$, $J_2$ and $C_d$ to converge is related to the residual mismatch, and whether both of them are a result of an error the codebase or just numerical artifacts of the linear filter. Based on the symptoms, I would say the error, if there is indeed one, is somewhere in the calculation of  $A$. This matrix links the linear model with the non-linear model, and an error here would likely cause this sort of error. This hypothesis is further born out by the results of my test module, which compares the 0th iteration values against the project reference values:

\begin{itemize}
\item A-matrix (first call) shows excellent agreement with solutions (less than E-12 \% error for all non-zero entries)
\item Htilda-matrix (first call) shows excellent agreement with solutions (less than E-9 \% error for all non-zero entries)
\item Integrated position / velocity show excellent agreement with solutions (less than E-7 \% error for t = 0 to 120 seconds)
\item Integrated state transition matrix showed unusually high errors in $C_d$ term
\item $H$ values show unusually high errors in $C_d$
\item $\hat{x}$ showed unusually high errors in $C_d$
\end{itemize}

The $H$ matrices and $\hat{x}$ are both a function of the state transition matrix, which is itself a function of $A$. However, thorough investigation of the $A$ partials continues to show them exactly matching the partials given in the project solution. Also, introducing an intentional ``small" error in the $A$ matrix tends to produce more noticeable errors in the fit (this is just an ad-hoc test where common coding errors such as sign reversals, bracket misplacement etc are introduced and their effect observed). Thus this issue remains unresolved.
